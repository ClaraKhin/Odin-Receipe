    <h4>
      Dragon's Beard Candy, originating from ancient China's Han Dynasty, is a
      confectionary marvel. <br />The candy got its name from the process of
      stretching a rice flour and sugar dough into thin, <br />sticky strands
      resembling a dragon's beard. Legend has it that an Imperial Court chef
      impressed <br />the Emperor with this technique, leading to the birth of
      Dragon's Beard Candy.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1000g / 2.2lb of sugar</li>
        <li>100g / 3.5oz of light corn syrup or maltose</li>
        <li>1 tsp of white vinegar</li>
        <li>500ml or 2 cups of water</li>
        <li>3 to 4 cups of corn starch or rice flour</li>
        <li>2 to 3 cups of peanuts</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Direction</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Creating the syrup is as simple as combining the sugar, corn syrup,
          vinegar, and water in a saucepan. No fuss, just a quick dump and mix!
        </li>
        <li>
          Securely attach the candy thermometer to the edge of the saucepan,
          ready to monitor the temperature with ease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apply medium-high heat and aim for a temperature of 133°C (271°F).
          Cook for 20-25 minutes, ensuring an optimal result.
        </li>
        <li>
          Resist stirring the syrup to prevent the formation of sugar crystals
          caused by agitation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cool the syrup to 100°C (212°F) before pouring it into a plastic mold.
          For silicone baking molds, no need to wait—pour away!
        </li>
        <li>
          While waiting for the syrup to cool or while it boils to the desired
          temperature, dry roast cornstarch or rice flour in a pan for 10
          minutes over low to medium heat, ensuring it doesn't brown. Set it
          aside to cool alongside the syrup pucks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next is to dry roast the peanuts in the same pan until cooked. Once
          that is done just chuck it into a food processor, blender or even chop
          it with a knife.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coat the ring with cornstarch, shape the candy with your hands, and
          dip as needed to prevent sticking in humid conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stretch the ring evenly, coat with cornstarch, and increase its size.
          Shape into a figure-8, fold for two strands, and coat with cornstarch
          again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Work the strands into figure-8 shapes, fold for more strands, and dip
          in cornstarch. Repeat this process for 11 folds, yielding around 2048
          strands. Optionally, continue for 3 more folds to reach a total of 14
          pulls and achieve 16384 strands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gently tear a 4-inch section of the "beard" to create a space for
          filling. Avoid cutting it, as it may cause merging, which should be
          avoided.
        </li>
        <li>
          Just spoon in some chopped peanuts in the middle of the 4inch bit,
          fold it in half and then roll it up. Done!
        </li>
